# Elemental Battles Tutorial Lessons

The Elemental Battles Tutorial is divided into easy to follow lessons that take you through the process of creating your own fully-functional blockchain-based dApp.

Each lesson will introduce new concepts and showcase how to include them in the existing code. Additionally, we will display explanations and source code side-by-side to make following the tutorial easy.
